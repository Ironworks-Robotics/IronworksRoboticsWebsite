            2019: Destination Deep Space
        </h2>
        <p>Founded in 2018, we are a new FIRST Robotics team from Alexander Mackenzie High School. During
            our rookie year in 2019, our team of around a dozen students and mentors competed at Durham College and
            Ryerson University as part of the Ontario District. </p>
        <p>At Ryerson, our team won both the Rookie All Star Award and Rookie Inspiration Award at Ryerson
            University, ending our first year of competition on a high note. </p>
        <p>Since then, our team has continued to grow, giving more students from all walks of life the
            chance to develop their skills in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics.</p>

        <h2>2020: Infinite Recharge</h2>
        <p>During our 2020 season, we competed at Humber College as a sophomore team. Though the results we
            were hoping for were not attained, we held our spirits high and worked around the clock for our second
            regional event.
        </p>
        <p>Unfortunately, after much dedication and late nights at school, the Ryerson competition was
            canceled due to COVID-19. We are disappointed about this outcome to say the least. Nonetheless, we are
            working hard to bring our team together again and stronger than ever to compete in the next year's First
            Robotics Competitions.

        <h2> 2021: At Home Challenges</h2>
        <p>
            Due to COVID-19 safety restrictions, the 2021 season was all done virtually. Still, the team had
            a great time working away at both the Game Design Challenge and the Innovation Challenge.
